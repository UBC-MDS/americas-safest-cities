## Usefulness of Feedback

The feedback session was very productive. We had the opportunity to review two projects, [Olympics Medal Exploration](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/Olympics_Medal_Exploration) and [Mental Health  in Tech Jobs](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/Mental_Health_in_TechJobs), and provided feedback [here](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/Olympics_Medal_Exploration/issues/10) and [here](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/Mental_Health_in_TechJobs/issues/4) respectively.

### Tab 1: Map of the US

In the **fly-on-the-wall** session, we noticed that the title _America’s Safest Cities_ placed the right expectation in the users’ mind that we had aimed for. The interactive map of the continental United States with distinctive circles centered on metropolitan cities across the country on the app’s splash page gravitated the users’ attention right away. After clicking on the circles and viewing the city’s details, users wanted to play with the filters and observe changes in circle sizes. Some users brought up that it is hard to compare so many circles with one another that are roughly equal in size, so it would be beneficial having a list of safest and most dangerous cities. This feature had been on our list of planned enhancements.

### Tab 2: Line graph comparing crime rate between cities

Moving to the second tab, users had to turn to the filters because the line chart didn’t display crime trends for any cities by default. This was noted as a feature to be enhanced. After selecting some cities in the drop-down selections and watching the line chart come to life, users got the message that the visualization intended to convey right away. There were mixed feelings about the flexibility to select trend duration (number of years before 2015). One point of view is that the missing data necessitates the full forty-year trend otherwise the trend doesn’t render for many cities. The other point of view is to maintain the feature and improve it with augmented data.

### Summary

We've summarized a list of proposed enhancements to the app. As we iteratively work through changes, we will be updating the checklist [here](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/americas-safest-cities/issues/14).
